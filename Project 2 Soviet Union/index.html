          <h1>Soviet Union</h1>
          <p>The Soviet Union,[n] officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics[o] (USSR),[p] was a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia from 1922 to 1991. 
             A flagship communist state, it was nominally a federal union comprising fifteen top-level republics;[q] in practice, both its government and its economy were built on a highly centralized model until its final years. 
             It was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,<br><br> with the city of Moscow serving as the capital of both the federal state and the Russian SFSR, which was its largest and most populous republic. 
             Other major cities in the Soviet Union included Leningrad (Russian SFSR), Kiev (Ukrainian SSR), Minsk (Byelorussian SSR), Tashkent (Uzbek SSR), Alma-Ata (Kazakh SSR), and Novosibirsk (Russian SFSR). It was the largest country in the world by land area, covering over 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 square miles) and spanning eleven time zones.<br><br> Soviet Union traces its origin to the 1917 October Revolution which saw the Bolsheviks, a far left-political party lead by Vladimir Lenin topple the Provisional Government and establish the RSFSR, the world's first constitutionally guaranteed socialist state.[r] The October Revolution followed the earlier 1917 February Revolution which saw the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II. Bolshevik seizure of power lead to a period of tension which erupted into the Russian Civil War, which pitted the Bolshevik lead RSFSR against their enemies, collectively called the White Army. In 1922, the White Army was defeated which spearheaded the creation of the Soviet Union and the reconstitution of the Bolsheviks into the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
             Following Lenin's death and state funeral in 1924, Joseph Stalin the party's General Secretary assumed leadership over the party and country.[8] Beginning a period of Soviet governance guided by Stalinism he inaugurated a period of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization, which led to significant economic growth but also contributed to the Soviet famine of 1930–1933. His rule also saw the expansion of the labour camp system under the Gulag. Between 1936 and 1938, Stalin carried out the Great Purge, a campaign of political repression through which he solidified his power by removing his actual and perceived opponents. In 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, opening up the Eastern Front of World War II. The combined Soviet civilian and military casualty figures—estimated to be around 27 million people—accounted for the majority of losses on the side of the Allies. The total defeat of the Axis in 1945 marked a formal cessation of hostilities, and the territories taken by Soviet forces subsequently formed various Soviet satellite states.<br><br>
             By 1947, newfound tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States had escalated into the Cold War. During this period, the Soviet-aligned Eastern Bloc confronted the American-aligned Western Bloc. The two sides consolidated their opposition to each other through ideology-based military alliances: the Warsaw Pact, which formed in 1955 to serve Soviet interests; and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which formed earlier in 1949 to serve American interests. Following Stalin's death and state funeral in 1953, a process of "de-Stalinization" was initiated by the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. The Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race with the first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1), the first human spaceflight (Vostok 1), and the first probe to land on another planet (Venera 7). Throughout the 1970s, there was a détente in Soviet Union–United States relations, but bilateral tensions resumed from 1979 onwards due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform the country through his policies of glasnost and perestroika. In the closing stages of the Cold War, various communist states were overthrown by the Revolutions of 1989, jeopardizing the Warsaw Pact. Unrest across the Eastern Bloc was also accompanied by the outbreak of strong nationalist/separatist movements within the Soviet Union itself. To address the question of the country's future preservation (or lack thereof), Gorbachev initiated the 1991 Soviet Union referendum—boycotted by the Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova—that resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favour of the New Union Treaty, which aimed to preserve the Soviet Union as a completely reformed country. Later that year, hardline members of the Communist Party staged the August Coup, which was unsuccessful in overthrowing Gorbachev's government; Boris Yeltsin played a high-profile role in facing down the unrest and the Communist Party was subsequently banned, accelerating the dissolution of the Soviet Union. By December 1991, all of the fifteen Soviet republics had emerged as fully independent post-Soviet states.<br><br>
             Throughout its existence, the Soviet Union was responsible for many social and technological achievements and innovations. It was a founding member of the United Nations, and also held influence as one of the "Permanent Five" of the United Nations Security Council. It had the world's second-largest economy, which led and influenced the Second World during the Cold War. The Soviet Armed Forces, which comprised the world's largest standing military at their peak, also possessed the world's largest nuclear weapons arsenal.[6][9][10] Alongside the United States, the Soviet Union maintained its status as one of the two superpowers of the world from the end of World War II until its dissolution; it exercised global influence through its hegemony in the Eastern Bloc, military and economic strengths, various forms of aid to the Third World, and scientific research.[11] </p>
